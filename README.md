# React JSON API

React JSON API is a library for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) that
provides declarative co-located data loading for React components from [JSON
APIs](http://jsonapi.org).

It is based on [Backbone-relational](http://backbonerelational.org/) and [React
Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3) (v3).
